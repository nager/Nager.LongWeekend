# Nager.LongWeekend

**Nager.LongWeekend** is a lightweight, open-source .NET library that helps you calculate potential long weekends based on public holidays.  
By providing a list of holidays and your defined weekend days, the library determines possible extended weekends â€” including those that can be created with optional bridge days.  

## âœ¨ Features  
- Detects long weekends based on given holiday data.  
- Supports custom weekend definitions (not just Saturday/Sunday).  
- Considers bridge days to extend weekends.  
- Simple API with minimal dependencies.  

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

The package is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nager.LongWeekend)
